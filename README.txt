DONATIONS

  All the material on the bonecode.com is free. The site does not advertise anything now, not ever.

  Although everything is free for you, that's not it for me. I have the cost of licenses,
  commercial components, and web hosting. I also use my precious free time to project development.

  If you experience any of my projects useful and want to support development in the future, any
  donation will help. Thank you.
